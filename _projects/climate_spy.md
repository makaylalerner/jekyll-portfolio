# Data Analysis of the Social Impact of Climate Change

## Overview

This project will analyze various datasets to measure the impact of climate change across different populations. This study seeks to identify socioeconomic factors, such as race, income, etc., which contribute to the varying degrees of climate change consequences across communities. The aforementioned "consequences of climate change" include changes in health, labor, and property. Finally, this project will use machine learning to predict futher consequences of climate change inaction. 

## Related Work
A few datasets were used to gather the whole picture:

## Initial Questions
*   Is there a correlation between the race of a population and the impact of rising temperatures on health? 
*   Is there a correlation between the race of a population and the impact of natural disasters on health?
*   Is there a correlation between the average income of a population and the impact of rising temperatures on health?
*   Is there a correlation between the average income of a population and the impact of natural diasters on health?
*   Are some populations more vulnerable to climate catastrophes than others?
*   How does the forecasted impact of climate change look across different populations? Are there trends related to socioeconomic factors? 

## Data
All datasets were adapted from curated Excel workbooks provided by the EPA. Excel Worksheets were stripped of formatting and saved as individual CSVs. Those CSVs were then uploaded to GitHub to be loaded in by link. After loading, each dataset was cleaned as needed, such as dropping and replacing NaN values. Not all data imported was used in the analysis. 

## Findings and Conclusion
It is known that minority and low income populations are at more risk to the consequences of climate change. This report looks at how risk increases with temperature and sea level across multiple factors.
